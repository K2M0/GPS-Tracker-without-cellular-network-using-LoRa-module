# GPS-Tracker-without-cellular-network-using-LoRa-module
Cellular networks limit the functionality of GPS trackers dependent on them. This project addresses the need for a secure GPS tracking of high-security personnel by developing a system that operates without reliance on cellular networks, utilizing LoRa (Long Range) technology for enhanced security.

Components Used:

Microcontrollers:
ESP8266 [for receiver]               (1)
ESP-WROOM-32 [for transmitter]       (1)

Modules:
Neo-6M GPS Module                    (1)
LoRa Ra-02                           (2)

Wires:
Female-to-Female wires
Female-to-Male wires
Male-to-Male wires

Softwares:
Arduino IDE
ThingSpeak
Blynk

Using this specific code, the GPS data that is latitude, longitude, altitude and speed are shown on ThingSpeak and Blynk. A link will also be generated on Blynk using which real-time location can be viewed on Google Maps.
The connection diagrams for both the transmitter and receiver are uploaded.
